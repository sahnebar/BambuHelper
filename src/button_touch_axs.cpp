// AXS15231B integrated touch backend (jc3248w535). See button_touch_backend.h.
// This is the one EDGE-MANAGED backend: it detects presses from INT-line ISR
// activity and releases from ISR quiescence, so it reports Pressed/Released
// events that bypass the shared 50 ms debounce. It keeps its own held-state;
// button.cpp mirrors it into the public hold getters via Pressed/Released.
//
// INT line: per manufacturer demo code the AXS15231B touch INT is on GPIO 3,
// active-low, and pulses low->high->low ~20-30 times while a finger is held
// (sub-100 ms gaps). Level-polling the I2C state misses sub-loop-rate taps, so we
// use the INT edge as the trigger.
